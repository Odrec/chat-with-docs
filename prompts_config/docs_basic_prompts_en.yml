Queries: "Directly provide 3 specific queries (ONLY PROVIDE THE QUERIES, NOTHING ELSE) based solely on the document's content. **DON'T WRITE ANYTHING ELSE BUT THE QUERIES.** These queries should aim to deepen the user's understanding of the document by addressing any notable details. **Format the response as a concise list of questions ONLY, with NO introductions, explanations, or comments before, between, or after the questions.** Use semicolons to separate each query. Ensure all queries are relevant to the document's content.

**Example queries, formatted correctly**:

'What is the main topic of the document?'
'Which are the most important aspects mentioned in the document?'
'Can you list any significant quotes mentioned?'"
